# Recipe Calculator üßÆ

The **Recipe Calculator** is an interactive and visually appealing web-based tool designed to help users easily scale their favorite recipes ü•ò. Built with modern web technologies, this tool allows you to adjust serving sizes and manage ingredients dynamically. Whether you're cooking for more people or downsizing a recipe, this app ensures precise calculations for your ingredients. The project utilizes **useReducer** to manage the state, which was specifically chosen to improve my understanding of state management in React. By using **useReducer**, the app handles complex state updates more efficiently, offering a more organized approach to managing the dynamic changes in the ingredients and servings.


## Features
- **Recipe Name Input**: Enter the recipe name for organization and reference.
- **Serving Size Scaling**: Adjust recipes by entering the original serving size and the desired scaling factor (e.g., doubling or halving).
- **Dynamic Ingredient Management**:
  - Add ingredients with names, quantities, and measurement units.
  - Automatically scales quantities based on the entered multiplier.
- **Clear Functionality**: Quickly reset all fields to start fresh.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes.
